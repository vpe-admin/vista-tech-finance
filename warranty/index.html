    <h6><i>Updated March 31st, 2022</i></h6>
     
    <p>V3 Distribution warrants that products purchased from us will be free from defects in materials and workmanship when in normal use for 90 days from the invoice date. This warranty is transferable to your customers. At your request we will modify or custom configure your order. We are not responsible for nor do we guarantee functionality, compatibility, or warranty. At our discretion, we may use refurbished, used or remanufactured parts or end-of-life components as necessary. We may use compatible or alternative parts when indicated.</p>
     
    <p>Date of purchase is defined as the invoice date from us. For the warranty period described above, V3 will issue a credit for defective parts and materials necessary for the warranted product(s). Products and serial numbers must match our records for the warranty to be honored. If the product(s) returned to us does not match our original or subsequent replacement parts or serial numbers, you agree to pay us for the replacement cost of the products.</p>
      
    <p>Products purchased from us with a manufacturer’s warranty, the manufacturer’s warranty process and support will take precedent over any of our warranty obligations. The customer must contact us first to initiate all warranty claims to determine what items are covered under the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty and/or our warranty. Failure to do so could void our warranty. At your request, we may help facilitate the OEM warranty process and at our discretion act an intermediary between you and the OEM. Our 90-day warranty is considered secondary to any OEM warranty. Should we choose to replace any OEM warranted products on your behalf, you are required to return the provided replacement products to us.</p>
     
    <p>Replacement parts do not extend the original warranty period. Replacement parts may be new, previously used, or refurbished. Replacement parts are warranted to be free from defects for the remainder of the original 90-day warranty period. We reserve the right to replace with equal or better technology without any incremental charges to the customer.</p>
      
    <p>Support will be provided using remote diagnosis or other service delivery methods at our sole discretion. This warranty does not cover any hardware or software installation, or maintenance costs of any warranted products. The 90 day warranty is return for credit only. After 90 days, there are no further warranty or support obligations owed to you.  All component parts or hardware products returned under this limited warranty become the property of us.</p>
     
    <p>You are responsible for paying shipping charges for the return of any defective parts to us during the warranty period. We are not responsible for any shipping damages incurred in transit from the customer to us.
